Implementation of Object Detection on Pictures, Videos, and Real-Time Webcam Feed Using YOLOv8 and Python
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of advanced object detection techniques using the YOLOv8 model, implemented in Python. It covers three key areas:

Object Detection in Images
Object Detection in Video Files
Real-Time Object Detection Using Webcam
Each area is handled by a distinct Python script, showcasing the flexibility and efficiency of YOLOv8 in different contexts.

Features
Object Detection in Images (YOLOv8_picture_OD.py)
Processes static images to detect and label objects, ideal for analyzing photographs or any single-frame content.

Object Detection in Videos (YOLO_Video_OD.py)
Processes video files frame-by-frame, demonstrating the model's capability in dynamic, multi-frame content.

Real-Time Object Detection (YOLO_OD_Live.py)
Utilizes a webcam for live video feed and real-time detection, highlighting applications in surveillance and interactive systems.

Technologies
YOLOv8: Latest iteration of the YOLO object detection models, renowned for speed and accuracy.
Python: Scripts are written in Python, popular in data science and machine learning.
OpenCV (cv2): For handling image and video operations.
Usage
Run each script as needed:

For images and videos, provide the path to the input file.
For real-time detection, a connected webcam is required.
Applications
Suitable for various domains like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, and interactive media.
